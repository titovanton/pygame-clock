# Cross-OS window Clock app
Setup any number of time zones and you get the same number of clocks within one window, with analog clock-faces. Useful for a freelancer, who is working World Wide and have free display to show clocks. Nothing breaking of a mind, more then that - it may be, that there are such projects already. I made if for fun and my own use.
